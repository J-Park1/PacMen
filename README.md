# PacMen


## Description
This is a basic project to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. The goal of the project is to create PacMen with a button and have all the PacMen start to move with a button.

## How to Run
Download the files. Open the index.html file in a browser. Add a PacMan by clicking the Add PacMen button. Make the PacMen move by clicking on the Start Game button.

## Future Improvements

  <li>Change the color of PacMan</li>
  <li>Stop the PacMen</li>
</ul>
